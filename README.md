# rensenWare
rensenWare(蓮船ウェアー, 련선웨어) is a ransomware. It does not demand victims for any money, but makes them play a Touhou Project game. It unlocks encrypted files when player scores over 200 million.

Following extensions are the target of rensenWare.
```
.jpg, .txt, .png, .pdf, .hwp, .psd, .cs, .c, .cpp, .vb, .bas, .frm, .mp3, .wav, .flac, .gif, .doc, .xls, .xlsx
.docx, .ppt, .pptx, .js, .avi, .mp4, .mkv, .zip, .rar, .alz, .egg, .7z, .raw
```
This repository does not contain the entire source code, but the core part is archived to explain what I wanted to do with this.

# Warning
The initial build of rensenWare (also initial release of source code) does not handle exceptions properly, so it can be terminated unexpectedly and may results permanent data loss.

SO PLEASE, **DO NOT EXECUTE IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!**

Also, DO NOT request me for the original source code of rensenWare. I decided not to provide it to anyone.

# Need Forcer?
Repository : https://github.com/0x00000FF/rensenware_force

Release : https://github.com/0x00000FF/rensenware_force/releases

The new version of Forcer (released in Dec. 18 KST) runs as decoy of rensenWare, so you don't have to buy or get Touhou game, unless you are really willing to play it.
