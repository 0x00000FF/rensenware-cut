# rensenWare
rensenWare(蓮船ウェアー, 련선웨어) is a ransomware. it does not demand to victims any money, but makes them play Touhou Project game and unlocks when player reaches 200 million points of score.

This repository does not contain original version of rensenWare, but core part is archived to say what I wanted to do with this.

# Warning
The initial build of rensenWare (also initial release of source code) has no exception handlers, so it can be terminated unexpectedly and results permanent data loss.

SO PLEASE, DO NOT EXECUTE IT IF YOU ARE NOT SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS SAFE FROM RENSENWARE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!

Also, DO NOT request me the entire(or encryption part) source code of rensenWare. I decided not to provide it to anyone.
